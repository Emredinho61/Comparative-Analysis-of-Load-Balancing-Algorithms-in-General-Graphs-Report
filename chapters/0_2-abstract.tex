\chapter*{Abstract}

In this work, we investigate the load balancing problem by comparing the Push-Pull Sum protocol proposed by Nugroho et al. \cite{nugroho2023PushPullSumDataAg} with the Single Proposal Load Balancing protocol introduced by Dinitz et al. \cite{dinitz2022localDealAgreementloadBalancing}. These protocols are designed for undirected graphs, where nodes transfer loads to their neighbors to achieve a balanced state across the network. The loads represent various computational tasks, such as CPU usage, memory utilization, or internet traffic. Balancing loads and therefore challenging over- and underloading helps improve the efficacy of distributed systems and prevent system and performance errors from occurring. In the context of cloud computing, such algorithms are important for reducing response times, ensuring system stability, and improving customer satisfaction.

To provide a comprehensive analysis, we implement the aforementioned load balancing protocols and evaluate their performance through simulations. Simulations are conducted using the PeerSim simulation tool, where we compare the progression of the mean squared error across multiple computation rounds. The simulations are performed on various topologies with different characteristics to identify the limitations and strengths of each protocol. For every topology, multiple simulations are conducted and then compared and analyzed.
