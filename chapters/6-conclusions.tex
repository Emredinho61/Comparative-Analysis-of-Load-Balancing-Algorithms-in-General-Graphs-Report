WWrite about that DAB able to balance perfectly MSE of 0. (complete graph and star graph). After some state of network DAB improves rapidly. PPS is other way around usually in beginning more impulsive and later in the end relatively slow. (lollipop graph). cliques and complete graphs favor PPS. PPS not anytime see star. Less connectivity favor DAB.
